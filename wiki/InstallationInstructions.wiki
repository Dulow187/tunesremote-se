== Requirements ==
TunesRemote-SE requires a Java 6 runtime environment to be able run.  I develop and test TunesRemote-SE using the Oracle Java runtime, though others may also work.

Windows, Solaris and Linux users can get the latest Oracle JRE here:
http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

Currently MacOSX ships with its own Java runtime, though in the future this is going to change.

Ubuntu instructions can be found here:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java

== Downloads ==
Mac users should download the latest Mac OSX release of TunesRemote-SE.
Everyone else should get the regular download.

== Windows ==
Unpack the zip file.  Double clicking on the included TunesRemoteSE.jar file should launch the application.  The first time you run TunesRemote-SE you will be asked where you want it to store files.

== Mac OSX ==
Mac users unpack the zip file and drag the TunesRemote-SE application to your Applications folder.  Double clicking the application will launch TunesRemote-SE.  The first time you run TunesRemote-SE you will be asked where you want it to store files.

== Linux / Other ==
Unpack the TunesRemoteSE.jar file from the zip file.
Launch the application by running:
{{{
java -jar TunesRemoteSE.jar
}}}
The first time you run TunesRemote-SE you will be asked where you want it to store files.
