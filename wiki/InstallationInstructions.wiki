== Requirements ==
TunesRemote-SE requires a Java 6 runtime environment to be able run.  I develop and test TunesRemote-SE using the Oracle Java runtime, though others may also work.

Windows, Solaris and Linux users can get the latest Oracle JRE here:

Currently MacOSX ships with its own Java runtime, though in the future this is going to change.

Ubuntu instructions can be found here:
