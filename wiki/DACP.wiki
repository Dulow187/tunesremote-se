=DACP=

Digital Audio Control Protocol (DACP) is a protocol used by the Apple Remote application (app) on iOS mobile devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch) to control iTunes running on a remote computer.

DACP is similar to the well-known DAAP, using Bonjour MDNS to find libraries, then using HTTP requests with binary responses to transfer data.
